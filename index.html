        <h1>cloudhost</h1>

<p>cloudhost is a proxy / data-storage for cloudapp build in php. You can use it with an existing account. The main difference is, file uploads are redirected to your own data-storage.
Cloudhost works as proxy until the fileupload ticket has been received / created. This upload ticket will be passed through to the client in a modified version, to redirect it to a different data-storage (instead of amazon s-3). The ticket will further be used to handle the upload at the new data-storage.</p>

<hr><h1>How it works:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Client = Cloudapp-Client </li>
<li>Server = cloudapp </li>
<li>Proxy = cloudhost</li>
</ul><p>Client authenticates with the server, through the proxy. The proxy does nothing in this case, it simply routes the traffic to the targets and stores some information it needs later.
Client ask for an item list, which can be either the one from cloudhost, from cloudapp or a combined list from both.
Client requests a new item ticket, which will be handled by the Server. The proxy then uses this ticket to create valid upload ticket for it's own data-storage and redirect it modified to the client.
The Client now starts a POST upload to the destination, the proxy gave him. The ticket is validated here and the upload is handled by the proxys data-storage.</p>

<p>Thats it!</p>
